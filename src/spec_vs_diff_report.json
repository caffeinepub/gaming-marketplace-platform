  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses both requirements. REQ-61 is implemented by adding a useIsAdminUsername() query hook in frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts that fetches the user's profile and checks their username against the backend admin whitelist. The Storefront component (frontend/src/pages/Storefront.tsx) uses this hook to enable/disable the admin button and show appropriate error messages. REQ-62 is implemented by initializing the backend adminUsernameWhitelist with 'venomgladiator25' and 'turbohunter64' in backend/main.mo, and the isAdminUsername() query function correctly checks this whitelist. The implementation properly verifies whitelisted usernames against authenticated users' stored usernames and grants immediate access to the admin panel.",
