  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-59 by adding 'venomgladiator25' to the admin username whitelist through a migration module. The implementation adds the username during canister upgrade via migration.mo, and the existing isAdminUsername query endpoint in main.mo remains unchanged, allowing the user to access the admin panel.",

    {
      "description": "Added addAdminUsername and removeAdminUsername functions in backend/main.mo",
      "reason": "These functions allow dynamic runtime management of the admin whitelist, which was explicitly listed as a non-goal: 'Creating a UI for managing the admin whitelist' and 'Adding multiple usernames at once'. The requirement only asked to add 'venomgladiator25' to the whitelist, not to create management functions.",
