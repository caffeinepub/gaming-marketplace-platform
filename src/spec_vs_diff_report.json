  "summary": "The diff implements all four core requirements for fixing user-not-found errors when adding phone numbers. The backend now checks for existing users before creating new records (REQ-90), validates phone number uniqueness (REQ-91), and the frontend displays specific error messages (REQ-92). The admin panel phone number addition functionality includes error handling (REQ-93). All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed in the implementation.",
