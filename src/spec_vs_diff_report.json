  "summary": "The implementation successfully adds social media icons (YouTube and Instagram) to both the LoginQueue and Storefront components, integrates Instagram URL configuration in the admin panel with validation, and stores the Instagram URL in the backend. However, the animated gaming background video (gaming-background.mp4) is referenced in the code but not actually generated or included in the diff, representing a missing requirement.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "Generate a custom animated video background that resembles dynamic gameplay footage for the login queue screen",
      "reason": "The code references '/assets/generated/gaming-background.mp4' in LoginQueue.tsx, but the diff shows no evidence that this video file was actually created or added to the project. The BuildRequest explicitly lists 'gaming-background.mp4' as a required image/asset, but it is not present in the ADDED FILES section.",
