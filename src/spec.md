# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a digital gaming marketplace where admins can list gaming accounts, in-game currency, and premium clothes for sale, and authenticated buyers can browse, add items to cart, and checkout with manual payment instructions.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication for buyers
- Create backend data model for products with game name, product type (account/currency/clothes), price in GBP, images, quantity, and game category
- Build admin panel for creating, editing, and deleting product listings (admin-only access)
- Implement admin access control in backend to restrict product management
- Create public storefront displaying products organized by game categories with filtering
- Add shopping cart functionality for authenticated buyers
- Build checkout flow showing payment instructions for PayPal, UK gift cards, and crypto
- Create payment configuration section in admin panel for updating payment details
- Implement game category management system
- Design bold, gaming-inspired visual theme with vibrant colors (excluding blue and purple)
- Render generated hero banner and category icons as static assets

**User-visible outcome:** Admins can manage product listings and payment methods through an admin panel, while buyers can authenticate, browse a gaming-themed storefront, add products to their cart, and view payment instructions at checkout.
